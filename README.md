## Formal Shell

This is a simple shell written in Go that provides a minimalistic interface for navigating and manipulating files and folders.

> [!WARNING]  
> This shell is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used in production environments. I made this to learn a bit of Golang and I will not use it myself unless people really support this.

## Features

- Custom `ls` command that displays files and folders with colors and icons
- Custom `cd` command that changes directories
- Custom `exit` command that gracefully exits the shell
